- The filtering and sorting logic is overly complicated when it could be written more concisely and understandably.
- The sortedBalances and formattedBalances could be combined into one function.
- Using the index as a key should be avoided because if elements are added or removed, the index will change, leading to updates of elements that have not changed their content.
- The useMemo in sortedBalances includes prices as a dependency, which is redundant because it is not used in the logic. This may cause the function to recompute unnecessarily whenever prices change.
- lhs used in the sortedBalances filtering function is not defined.
- Some types in WalletBalance such as Priority and blockchain are not defined.
- The getPriority function should define a type for its parameter instead of using any.
